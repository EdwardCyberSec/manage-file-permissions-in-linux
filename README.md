<h1>Managing File Permissions Using Linux Commands</h1>

<h2>Languages And Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Linux</b> 
- <b>Current File Permissions File</b>
  
<h2>Description</h2>

The research team at my (fictitious) organization needed to update the file permissions for certain files and directories inside the projects directory. The current permissions did not reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure. To complete this task, I performed the following tasks.

<h2>Checking File And Directory Details</h2>

The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to determine the existing permissions set for a specific directory in the file system.

The first line displays the command I entered, while the other lines display the output. The code lists all contents of the projects directory. I used the "ls" command with the "-la" option to show a detailed list of the file contents that also returned hidden files. 

The output of my command indicated that there is one directory named drafts, one hidden file named ".project_x.txt", and five other project files. Each entry in the first column is a 10-character string representing the permissions assigned to each file or directory.


<h2>Describing The Permissions String</h2>

The 10-character string can be deconstructed to determine who is authorized to access the file and their specific permissions. The characters and what they represent are as follows:

 - 1st character: This character is either a d or hyphen (-) and indicates the file type. If it’s a d, it’s a directory. If it’s a hyphen (-), it’s a regular file.
 - 2nd-4th characters: These characters show the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the user. When one of these characters has a hyphen (-) instead, it indicates that this permission is not granted to the user.

- 5th-7th characters: These characters show the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the group. When one of these characters has a hyphen (-) instead, it indicates that this permission is not granted for the group.

- 8th-10th characters: These characters show the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the owner type of other. This owner type consists of all other users on the system aside from the user and the group. When one of these characters is a hyphen (-) instead, that shows that this permission is not granted for other.

For example, let's consider the file permissions for "project_t.txt" as an example: -rw-rw-r--. Here's what each character represents:

- The first character is a hyphen (-), indicating that "project_t.txt" is a regular file, not a directory.
- The second, fifth, and eighth characters are all "r," indicating that the user, group, and others have read permissions for "project_t.txt."
- The third and sixth characters are "w," signifying that only the user and group have write permissions, while others do not.
- Finally, the fourth, seventh, and tenth characters are hyphens (-), indicating that no user, group, or others have execute permissions for "project_t.txt."

<h2>Changing File Permissions</h2>

The research team determined that 'other' users shouldn't have write access to any of the files. To follow this, I referred to the file permissions that I previously returned. I determined project_k.txt required the removal of the write access removed for 'other' users.

To achieve this, I used the following Linux commands:

In the provided screenshot, the initial two lines showcase the commands I executed, while the subsequent lines demonstrate the output generated by the second command. The "chmod" command changes the permissions on files and directories. The first argument shows what permissions should be changed, while the second argument specified the file or directory. I removed the write permissions from other for the "project_k.txt" file. I then used "ls -la" to review the updates I made.

<h2>Changing File Permissions On A Hidden File</h2>

At my organization, the research team has recently archived "project_x.txt." To ensure that no one has write access to this project, we have set the permissions to allow only read access for both the user and the group.

The following Linux commands were used to achieve this:

In the provided screenshot, the initial two lines exhibit the commands I executed, while the subsequent lines reveal the output of the second command. I am aware that the file ".project_x.txt" is a hidden file denoted by the prefix period (.). In this instance, I modified the permissions by eliminating write access for both the user and the group, and concurrently introduced read permissions exclusively for the group. To be precise, I revoked the user's write permission using "u-w" and then eliminated the group's write permission using "g-w," while simultaneously granting the group read permission using "g+r."

<h2>Changing Directory Permissions</h2>

In my organization, exclusive access to the 'drafts' directory and its contents is restricted to the researcher2 user. Only researcher2 should have execute permissions, and no other user should be granted this privilege.

To enforce these permissions, I have utilized Linux commands to modify the access rights. The following code exemplifies the changes made:

In the screenshot provided, the first two lines show the commands I executed, while the subsequent lines display the output of the second command. As I had previously identified that the group had execute permissions, I utilized the chmod command to remove those permissions. However, it was not necessary to add execute permissions for the researcher2 user since they already had them.

<h2>Summary</h2>

To ensure that files and directories in the projects directory aligned with our organization's desired level of authorization, I made several changes to their permissions. The initial step involved checking the existing permissions for the directory using the command "ls -la." This helped inform my subsequent decisions. Afterwards, I utilized the "chmod" command multiple times to modify the permissions on individual files and directories accordingly.
